# Project ReadMe: The Colibri Digital Office

Welcome to the Colibri Digital Office project! This workspace is designed to provide a robust, interconnected schema for managing all aspects of a modern, AI-enabled digital office using Notion as the primary platform.

## Overview
The Colibri Digital Office schema enables:
- Centralized documentation and knowledge management
- Project and task tracking with RACI roles
- AI system inventory and compliance tracking
- Value-driven workstreams and culture measurement
- Recruiting, onboarding, and CRM workflows
- Tech stack and competitive landscape management
